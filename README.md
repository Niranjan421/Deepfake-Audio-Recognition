## About The Project
Certainly! Here’s a concise breakdown of a deepfake audio detection project using an RNN model in four short points:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather Data: Collect a dataset of genuine and deepfake audio samples.
Feature Extraction: Convert audio into spectrograms or MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) for input to the RNN.
Model Development:

Build RNN: Design an RNN (e.g., LSTM or GRU) to process sequential audio features.
Train Model: Train the RNN on the processed audio data to classify audio as real or deepfake.
Model Evaluation:

Assess Performance: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a validation dataset.

Deployment and Monitoring:

 Implement the trained RNN model in a real-time system for deepfake audio detection.
Monitor: Continuously track the model’s performance and update it as needed to handle new deepfake techniques.
